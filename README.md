# 🧑‍💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts employee salaries based on key features such as experience, education level, and job level using machine learning models. The goal is to demonstrate how regression techniques can be applied to build data-driven salary estimation systems.

## 📌 Project Description

Accurate salary prediction helps HR teams, job seekers, and companies to benchmark salaries, avoid bias, and optimize compensation planning. This project uses Python and scikit-learn to build, train, and evaluate models like **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** on a custom dataset.

## 📁 Dataset

A synthetic dataset is used with the following features:

- `Experience` (in years)
- `Education_Level` (0 = Bachelor's, 1 = Master's)
- `Job_Level` (1 to 5)
- `Salary` (target variable in INR)

> You can modify this dataset or upload your own `.csv` to make it more realistic.
